# Udemy_MERN_Project
Social Networking Site for Developers

This project was developed with the MERN stack in following a Udemy course.
The project was deployed on Heroku and can be found on this link: https://radiant-fortress-43330.herokuapp.com/

On the website, you can create an account using an email and password.  Both the email and password are stored in a database on MongoDB, as well as any other user information the user provides upon creating and editing their profile.  After creating an account, users can create and edit their profile, as well as participate in discussions (which are also stored in a database in MongoDB).  On a profile, a user can show their credentials and education (stored in a database in MongoDB).  Participation in discussions includes commenting on posts, liking or unliking posts, and creating your own post for other users to comment on or like.  Users can delete their posts or comments if they want by clicking the X button by it.  If a user wishes to delete their account, they can do that by going to their profile and clicking the Delete Account button.  User actions are confirmed for them with small pop ups which fade away after a few seconds.
